## Biography
---
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) at the University of Hong Kong. Prior to this, I earned my M.S. degree in applied physics from Delft University of Technology in 2023, where I collaborated with Prof. [L. Kuipers](https://kuiperslab.tudelft.nl/). Before that, I completed my B.S. in mathematics-physics fundamental science at the Yingcai Honor College of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2021.
