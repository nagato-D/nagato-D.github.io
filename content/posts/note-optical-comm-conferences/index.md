## Summary

---

In the field of optical communication, there are three widely recognized premier academic conferences. They are the Optical Fiber Conference (OFC), European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC), and Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO).

## Optical Fiber Conference (OFC)

---

- Homepage: https://www.ofcconference.org/en-us/home/
- Date: Every year in Mar.
- Duration: 5 days
- Location: Usually California, U.S.

OFC is the premier international academic conference on optical communications and networks. The first OFC was held in 1975, and this conference was mostly held in California [[1](#reference)]. Currently, the OFC is organized on a year basis and is usually conducted in March. Notably, Huawei Inc. plays a major role in OFC, with 47 times of appearances in the OFC agenda in 2023.

## European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC)

---

- Homepage: https://www.ecocexhibition.com/conference/
- Date: Every year in Sep.
- Duration: 5 days
- Location: Europe, the specific country varies every year

ECOC is the leading conference on optical communications in Europe. ECOC and OFC are widely recognized as two best academic conferences on optical communications. The ECOC conference is associated with an exhibition, known as the ECOC exhibition, where optical communication technology companies can share their latest developments with customs.

## Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO)

---

- Homepage: https://www.cleoconference.org/home/
- Date: Every year in May
- Duration: 6 days
- Location: Usually California, U.S.

CLEO is a top-level academic conference on optics, laser science, and optoelectronics. Although some people think the works presented in this conference can hardly match these presented in OFC and ECOC in terms of their quality, CLEO is still widely recognized as one of the best conferences on optical communications.
