## Introduction

---

An optoelectronic oscillator is an RF (radio-frequency) oscillator that incorporates an optical section to enhance loop delay and reduce phase noise. This type of oscillator shows promise in generating low-noise high-frequency microwave signals, which are crucial for applications such as 5G communication, test and measurement equipment, and remote sensing. In this document, we will discuss the structure and operation principles of optoelectronic oscillators. We will also present a mathematical framework, originally derived by X. Steve Yao and Lute Maleki at CalTech, that describes the oscillation frequency, amplitude, and noise spectrum of optoelectronic oscillators.
