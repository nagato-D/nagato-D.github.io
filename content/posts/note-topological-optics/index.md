## Questions Answered in this Note
---
+ [x] How is the 5D synthetic dimension defined?
+ [x] How to realize the 5D topologically nontrivial material in experiments?
+ [x] How is the sample fabricate?
+ [x] What measurements have been made?
+ [x] What experimental evidences are provided to support the existence of generalized chiral zero modes?

## Background
---
+ Graphene, as a gapless 2D material, has a special effective Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = k_{x}\hat{\sigma}_{x} + k_{y}\hat{\sigma}_{y}$, where $\hat{\sigma}_{x,y}$ are two anti-commute operators.
+ When an external magentic field is applied to a graphene, there will be a topologically nontrivial energy gap openning, associated with the emergence of chiral edge states.
+ However, limited by the available spacetime dimensions, previous demonstrations of such phenomena have been limited to 2D or 3D systems.

## Introduction to 5D Synthetic Momentum Space
---
+ 4-band system --> 15 generators with 5 anti-commute operators --> can couple to 5 pseudo momenta and form an effective 5D synthetic space.
+ 2nd order Chern number is an integral of the Berry curvature over a 4D surface in the 5D synthetic space.
+ Yang monopole transforms into linked Weyl surfaces under certain perturbations.
+ The two wavevectors that describe the Weyl sufaces are named $(k_{m}, k_{n})$, while other three are denoted as $(k_{i}, k_{j}, k_{k})$.
+ Each point on the 2D Weyl surface is a Weyl point in the three co-dimensions normal to the surface.
+ The parameter space of bianisotropic materials can be used to define a synthetic momentum space. 

## Contribution
---
+ "We for the first time **experimentally** demonstrate the existence fo the **generalized gapless CZM** induced by the **coupling between this pseudovector field $T$ and the second Chern singularity** in such a higher-dimensional second-order topological system." [1]

## Results
---
+ The authors employ bianisotropic materials for building up a 5D analog of 2D/3D topological materials such as graphene.
+ The authors transform the Maxwell's equations in this material to an antisymmetric form, obtaining three available synthetic dimensions that can be taken as additional momentum components.
+ These synthetic dimensions correspond to the three parameters of the 3-form antisymmetric $\xi$ tensor, respectively.
+ The Hamiltonian of EM fields in the bianisotropic material written with these synthetic dimensions is similar to that of traditional topological materials.
+ The Hamiltonian contains an external field-material-mode coupling term, which can be taken as the coupling between the 5D pseudovector field $T$ and a 4-form gauge field.
+ By tuning the structure of the metamaterial, one can adjust the coupling term (e.g., adding metal lines --> break mirror symmetries --> induce certain nonzero $\xi$ components).
+ Metamaterials fabricated on a printed circuit board. 
+ Electric field distribution and photonic dispersion were measured by using a near-field scanning probe.
+ The measurement results indicate that, near the plasma frequency, both the mode distribution and dispersion become polarization-dependent, evidencing the existence of polarized zero mode.

## Take-Home Messages
---
+ Use EM coupling tensor of bianisotropic materials to define synthetic material in metamaterials.
+ Such material has an effective Hamiltonian similar to that of graphene.
+ The Hamiltonian contains an effective external field-pseudovector coupling term.
+ The coupling term can be tuned by adjusting the structure of metamaterials.
+ Generalized chiral edge modes have been observed in such systems.
+ Features of 5D Yang-monopole metasurfaces: nonzero 2nd Chern number.
+ Future work: try to realize metamaterials with nontrivial Non-Abelian topological properties.
