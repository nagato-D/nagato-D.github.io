## Introduction

---

Traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate enable high-bandwidth, low-voltage encoding of RF signals onto optical carrier waves, which is essential for realizing high-speed, power-efficient data communication. In this note, I introduce a numerical method to calculate the modulation efficiency and bandwidth of traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators. We will use COMSOL simulation to reproduce the simulation results in [[1](#reference)].

## Code and Simulation Files

---

My COMSOL simulation files and codes for calculating the modulation efficiency and bandwidth of a traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulator are available using the following links. The computation method has been introduced in detail in the corresponding `readme.pdf` file.
