      <title>Note on Spontaneous Synchronization of Coupled Nonlinear Oscillators</title>

      <description>Introduction The harmonic oscillator is a simple physical model that has been widely used to describe all sorts of oscillations, including acoustic, electromagnetic, and even atomic oscillations. Yet, this model has a limitation in that it cannot explain the ubiquitous phenomenon of spontaneous synchronization of coupled oscillators. This can be observed in scenarios such as mechanically coupled pendulums, phase-locked electrical oscillators, and circadian rhythms synchronized to the environment. To understand these phenomena, we need to take into account the nonlinear dynamical properties of the oscillation, which are absent in the harmonic oscillator model.</description>

      <description>Introduction Traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate enable high-bandwidth, low-voltage encoding of RF signals onto optical carrier waves, which is essential for realizing high-speed, power-efficient data communication. In this note, I introduce a numerical method to calculate the modulation efficiency and bandwidth of traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators. We will use COMSOL simulation to reproduce the simulation results in [1].
Code and Simulation Files My COMSOL simulation files and codes for calculating the modulation efficiency and bandwidth of a traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulator are available using the following links.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Phase-locked Loop The phase-locked loop (PLL) is an electronic module that generates a signal with a stable frequency. The idea is to introduce a feedback loop that calculates the instantaneous phase (or frequency) drift of an oscillator and corrects it. The basic architecture of a PLL is depicted in Figure 1.
Basic architecture of a phase-locked loop [1].The PLL comprises a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a reference oscillator (OSC), and a feedback loop that stabilizes the frequency of the VCO.</description>

      <title>Note on Relation Between Near-Field Mode Dimensions and Far-Field Pattern</title>
      <link>https://nagato-D.github.io/posts_content/note-mode-field-dimension/</link>

      <guid>https://nagato-D.github.io/posts_content/note-mode-field-dimension/</guid>
      <description>For a semiconductor laser chip, the far-field divergence angle is directly connected to the mode field dimensions measured at its optical exit facet. This relation is quite useful for estimating the far-field pattern of a semiconductor laser from its waveguide mode profile and vice versa. In this note, we give an introduction to this relation. We also apply this relation to a commercial semiconductor gain chip (model: Thorlabs SAF1126C RSOA) to derive the chip&amp;rsquo;s near-field mode dimensions from its far-field specifications.</description>

      <description>NoteThis page presents only the introduction section of this note. Please refer to here for a complete version.Introduction Collimated and narrow laser beams are ideal for many industrial applications, including free-space communication, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and material processing. Practical laser beams, however, are not perfectly collimated and always bear finite divergence angles. That is to say, the diameter of the laser beam changes along its propagation direction.</description>

      <description>PDF versionPlease refer to here for a PDF version of this note.Introduction to Kerr Nonlinearity and Solitons Kerr effect refers to the phenomenon that the refractive index of a material changes linearly with the intensity of an external electric field. Light passing through a material with the Kerr effect can induce a refractive index change since light is associated with an oscillating electric field. Formally, this change in refractive index is formulated as $\Delta n = n_{0}+n_{2}I$ [1].</description>

      <description>Introduction Mode-locked lasers are a special class of lasers that generate periodic short optical pulses. These lasers operate by exciting multiple modes that emit light at specific phase differences, resulting in periodic constructive interference and high-energy optical pulses. This mechanism, which creates a periodic sequence of optical pulses, is called mode locking.
Mode-Locking Methods There are two main approaches to realizing a mode-locked laser: active mode locking and passive mode locking [1].</description>

      <description>PDF versionPlease refer to here for a PDF version of this note.Introduction A single-mode fiber with a circularly symmetric cross-section does not exhibit birefringence, meaning that the effective index of the mode remains the same regardless of the polarization state. This polarization degeneracy allows the two independent polarization states to easily couple when subjected to external perturbations, such as strain or bending.
Polarization-maintaining fibers (PM fibers or PMFs) are a special class of optical fibers designed to intentionally introduce birefringence.</description>
