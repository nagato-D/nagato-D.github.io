    <description><![CDATA[Introduction When light travels through a waveguide, its phase undergoes periodic changes as it moves along. The effective index is a measure of how frequently these phase changes occur compared to the wavelength of light in free space, but with the same frequency. Mathematically, the effective index, denoted as $n_{\rm eff}$, is defined as [1]:
$$ n_{\rm eff} = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi}\beta = \frac{\beta}{k}, $$
where $\beta$ represents the propagation constant of a specific mode in the waveguide.]]></description>
